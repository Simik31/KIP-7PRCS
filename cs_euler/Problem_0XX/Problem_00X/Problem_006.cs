/*
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1+2+...+10)^2=55^2=3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025−385=2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
